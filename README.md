Therapy Tool to select stretches for cutaneous hand injuries.
Instructions for using Cutaneokinematic Hand App

The hand app is intended for use with smaller, more specific skin injuries that do not include the entire hand. Any circumferential injuries or injuries that affect the entire dorsal or volar surfaces of a hand will be best recorded by the Cutaneokinematic Body App.

The user can click on Hand Cutaneokinematic regions affected by injuries. 
Each selected region will turn red and return information at the bottom of the screen under three labeled sections: Skin Affected, Stretches to Perform, and Potential Functional Implications. 
Clicking on a region a second time, will deselect that region and remove data output for that section at the bottom of the screen. 
At the bottom of the image, the program will display the list of cutaneokinematic selections followed by a list of prescribed stretches for full-thickness and deep partial-thickness injuries. 
The last list is possible functional implications from injuries to these different skin regions. 
The Functional Implications list is not exhaustive but rather general insight by the database authors based on locations of injuries. 
The "Clear Selections" button will clear all selection of hand regions and corresponding information so the clinician can start over.

Special instructions for mobile use.
This app can be used on all mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets.
When used on a mobile device, the user can pinch-in or out with two fingers for zooming in and out.
Scrolling up and down can be done with one finger.
